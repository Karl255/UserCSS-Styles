# UserCSS-Styles
My own small UserCSS styles which I wrote for various reasons.

# Installation
First you'll need one of the following extensions:
- Stylus ([Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/styl-us/), [Chrome or Edge](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne), [Opera](https://addons.opera.com/en-gb/extensions/details/stylus/))
- xStyle ([Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/xstyle/) or [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/xstyle/hncgkmhphmncjohllpoleelnibpmccpj))

Then open the [.user.css](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Karl255/UserCSS-Styles/master/github-monday.user.css) file of the style you want to isntall (using github-monday as an example) in raw mode and an installation window should automatically pop up (if not, simply copy paste the UserCSS code into a new Stylus UserCSS style).

# Styles
Short descriptions of each of my styles:

## github-monday
A UserCSS style to fix the calendar's first day of week on GitHub user profiles. This is achived by moving the squares into the positions where they should be.

## e-Dnevnik Material Dark
Material UI tamna tema za [e-Dnevnik](https://ocjene.skole.hr).

(Material UI dark theme for [e-Dnevnik](https://ocjene.skole.hr).)
